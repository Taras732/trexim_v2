        "content": "## What is E-TTN?\n\nElectronic Transport Document (E-TTN) is a digital document that replaces paper waybills. From January 1, 2026, it becomes mandatory for all participants in the logistics chain in Ukraine.\n\n## Why It Matters?\n\nTransitioning to E-TTN is not just digitizing documents. It's a step towards:\n- **Transparency**: all operations are recorded in a single system\n- **Time savings**: processing takes minutes instead of hours\n- **Fewer errors**: automatic form filling and data validation\n\n## How to Prepare?\n\n### 1. System Integration\nYou need to integrate your accounting system with the state E-TTN registry. Trexim provides ready-made APIs for quick integration.\n\n### 2. Staff Training\nYour drivers and logistics staff need to learn to work with the new system. We offer free training materials.\n\n### 3. Testing\nTest the system in pilot mode before the end of 2025 to avoid problems after launch.\n\n## Trexim Will Help\n\nOur platform fully supports E-TTN:\n- Automatic creation and sending\n- Electronic signature\n- Integration with 1C and other systems\n- Mobile app for drivers\n\nJoin the pilot program and be ready for 2026!"
